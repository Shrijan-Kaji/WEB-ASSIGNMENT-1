            Throughout the CSY1063 Web Development module, I learned the fundamentals
            of building modern, responsive websites using HTML and CSS. At the start,
            understanding semantic HTML tags was challenging, especially knowing when
            to use elements such as <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, and <code>section</code>.
            However, with practice, my confidence improved significantly.

            One of the most valuable skills I developed was using CSS Grid and media
            queries to create responsive layouts. Designing for mobile first made me
            rethink layout structure and navigation. Implementing a hamburger menu
            was initially difficult, but debugging helped me understand how CSS and
            JavaScript interact.

            I chose a simple color palette with blue and dark tones to keep the website
            professional and readable. The design was influenced by modern portfolio
            websites that prioritize simplicity and usability. Fonts were kept default
            for accessibility and clarity.

            GitHub usage was an important part of this project. Making regular commits
            helped me track progress and fix mistakes easily. Validation using W3C tools
            ensured that all HTML and CSS files followed web standards.Developing my portfolio website for CSY1063 has been both a challenging and rewarding experience. At the start of the            
module, I had only a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but through consistent practice I was able to build confidence in structuring web pages and applying styles effectively. My site consists of five pages—home, projects, contact, video demo, and site report—each linked through a responsive navigation menu. Ensuring consistency across all pages was one of my main priorities, so I adopted a clean layout with a simple color palette and a sans-serif font to maintain readability.

One of the biggest learning points was responsive design. Initially, my pages looked fine on desktop but were cluttered on mobile. By experimenting with media queries and flexible grid layouts, I redesigned the site to adapt smoothly to smaller screens. Implementing a hamburger menu for mobile navigation was particularly satisfying, as it demonstrated my ability to apply CSS concepts beyond the basics. Debugging these features taught me patience and the importance of validating my code regularly. Screenshots of my validation reports confirm that both HTML and CSS passed without major issues.

Design decisions were influenced by modern portfolio sites I researched online. I chose a minimalist approach, using whitespace strategically to highlight content. Placeholder images on the project page were arranged in a grid to showcase my ability to use CSS layout techniques. The contact page includes a functional form that launches the user’s email program, meeting module requirements despite the absence of server-side scripting.

Throughout development, I committed my code to GitHub regularly, documenting changes with meaningful messages. This not only tracked my progress but also reinforced good version control habits. Overall, this project helped me understand the fundamentals of web development, from design principles to technical implementation, while also improving my problem-solving and reflective skills.
