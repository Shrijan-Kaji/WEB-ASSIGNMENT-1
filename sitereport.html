        <p>
            Throughout the CSY1063 Web Development module, I learned the fundamentals
            of building modern, responsive websites using HTML and CSS. At the start,
            understanding semantic HTML tags was challenging, especially knowing when
            to use elements such as <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, and <code>section</code>.
            However, with practice, my confidence improved significantly.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most valuable skills I developed was using CSS Grid and media
            queries to create responsive layouts. Designing for mobile first made me
            rethink layout structure and navigation. Implementing a hamburger menu
            was initially difficult, but debugging helped me understand how CSS and
            JavaScript interact.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose a simple color palette with blue and dark tones to keep the website
            professional and readable. The design was influenced by modern portfolio
            websites that prioritize simplicity and usability. Fonts were kept default
            for accessibility and clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
            GitHub usage was an important part of this project. Making regular commits
            helped me track progress and fix mistakes easily. Validation using W3C tools
            ensured that all HTML and CSS files followed web standards.
